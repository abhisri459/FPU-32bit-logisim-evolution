# FPU-32bit-logisim-evolution

32 bit Floating point digits Arithemetic Logic units with test vectors in Logisim evolution.

Use of Logisim simulator to construct your 32-bit Floating-pointUnit (FPU). Your FPUmust  support  following arithmetic operations on realnumbersrepresented using IEEE 754 FP standard
▪Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division,   where   appropriate rounding logic is to be incorporated to produce mostaccurate resultGenerate 2-bit  operation  code  to  produce 4combinations  for 4operations (ADDF, SUBF, MULF, DIVF), which is to be used by controllogic to control different componentsof FPU.
Input: two 32-bit binary real numbers(as per IEEE 754 FP standard)
Output:  One 32-bit  binary real number(as  per IEEE  754  FP  standard)torepresent mostaccurate result, Flag bits (Overflow, Sign, Zero)
